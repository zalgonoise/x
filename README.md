### `/x/` 

Experimental Go libraries _(take it with a grain of salt)_

______________

### Concept

This repository contains projects, experiments and studies when developing new Go libraries and applications.

Its content ranges from HTTP / net utilities, generics in Go, binary encoding, to audio processing and much more in between. In `/x/` many ideas are born, and some eventually ported to their own repositories.  

This is the place for trying something new, to study it and amplify an initial idea. It's a place to be unbounded and unconstrained; to both succeed and to fail.
